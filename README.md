# Fraud-Detection-in-Python
A typical organization loses an estimated 5% of its yearly revenue to fraud. In this course, you will learn how to fight fraud by using data. For example, you'll learn how to apply supervised learning algorithms to detect fraudulent behavior similar to past ones, as well as unsupervised learning methods to discover new types of fraud activities. Moreover, in fraud analytics you often deal with highly imbalanced datasets when classifying fraud versus non-fraud, and during this course you will pick up some techniques on how to deal with that.
